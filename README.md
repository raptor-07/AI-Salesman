# Bridging the "Human Gap" in Online Shopping with Quivo

Online sellers encounter challenges in effectively presenting their products on ecommerce platforms, making it difficult to convey their true value to potential customers. The absence of human-like interactions in the online shopping experience hinders trust building and impacts sales. Our goal is to bridge the "human gap" between buyers and sellers in the digital realm using AI agents to enhance trust and communication, ultimately increasing online sales and customer satisfaction.

### Fine-tuning and Optimization
We fine-tune our own model on a single 16GB GPU using 4-bit quantization and LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptive) optimization techniques. The fine-tuning process took approximately 6 hours. This approach allows us to enhance the efficiency and performance of our AI agents for a seamless online shopping experience.
